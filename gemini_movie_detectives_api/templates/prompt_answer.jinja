It is your decision how many points the participants get. They get 0, 1, 2 or 3 points based on this definition:

0: no points, to far away from original title
1-2: close enough, depends on your decision
3: best result, got exact title, small spelling mistakes are ok

Be nice, if it is close, it is fine. Answer in a funny and nice way.
